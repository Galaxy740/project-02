TechSupport

You're working on the tech support team of an airline company, and your boss has asked you to implement a feature that shows the number of available seats on every flight.
Information about the airline is stored in a DataBase. You store the unique code for every flight, its destination, plane - at least number of seats on the plane, prurchases - flight and seats purchased. You are free to store any additional information you consider important for your web application to work correctly.

After you login with username and password as admin, you may sell tickets in order to change their availability.
Admin also CRUDs tickets` and flights` information.

Users without login can see a resulting table with columns displaying each filght and the number of seats that have not been purchased yet. The rows of the table should be ordered by flight_id in ascending order. It is guaranteed that the information in table purchases is consistent and there are no purchases for non-existing flight_ids or seat_nos.

Your additional task is to allow users to search for ticket availability for a flight. The should be able to search by flight code, destination or time of departure.
